### Project Overview

- This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road safety trends in the United States by examining the relationship between traffic fatalities and government spending on transportation and safety infrastructure. By integrating multiple publicly available datasets, the project evaluates whether increased investment in infrastructure and safety programs is associated with improved roadway safety outcomes across states and over time.

- The project demonstrates applied skills in data cleaning, integration, analysis, and visualization, with a focus on producing insights that can inform data-driven policy decisions.

### Objectives

- The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze historical trends in traffic fatalities across U.S. states

- Examine federal and state-level spending related to transportation and road safety

- Evaluate relationships between spending patterns and safety outcomes

- Compare state-level performance to identify high-risk and high-impact regions

- Communicate insights through clear and interpretable visualizations

### Data Sources

- This project uses authoritative public datasets, including:

- Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
  Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- Provides annual traffic fatality data at the state level

- Transportation and Infrastructure Spending Data
  Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and U.S. Department of Transportation
- Includes government expenditure related to transportation and infrastructure

- Supplementary State-Level Data 
- Includes population or demographic indicators used for normalization

- All datasets are aggregated at the state-year level to ensure consistency in analysis.
